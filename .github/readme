doasedit(8)

NAME
    doasedit - sudoedit for doas.

SYNOPSIS
    doasedit file

DESCRIPTION
    doasedit allows a permitted user to edit root-owned files by running an unpriviledged editor.

    This fork inlines readlinkf_posix from upstream's upstream, performs minor formatting, and
    passes shellcheck. It also removes upstream's repeated use of `doas` invocations. If you
    require elevated permissions to even access the file you're attempting to edit, refer to
    upstream. `doas` will be only invoked once the file is attempting to be saved, rather than
    eagerly while attempting to access said file's contents.

EXAMPLES
    To run an editor as non-root:

        $ doasedit /etc/doas.conf

TIPS
    Use this script with enabled persistence in doas.conf file, like:

        `permit persist :wheel`

    Also make sure that your doas.conf is owned by root with read-only permissions, like:

        # chown -c root:root /path/to/doas.conf && chmod 0400 path/to/doas.conf
